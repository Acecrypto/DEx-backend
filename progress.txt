this document has my thought process while working

so first lets make a route to return hey
models have been created

one doubt is how are they getting the transaction after it is mined ? probably etherscan

second it find out when they are hitting events end point
what is return ticker being used for .


so we are accepting only one thing that is order model

the orders endpoint gives out buy order and sell order both , it is used to get orders for a given token

orders are the fulfilled orders

top orders are the pending orders

finally clear ho hi gya !
