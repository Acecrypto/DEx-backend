this document has my thought process while working

so first lets make a route to return hey
models have been created

one doubt is how are they getting the transaction after it is mined ? probably etherscan

second it find out when they are hitting events end point
what is return ticker being used for .


the orders endpoint gives out buy order and sell order both , it is used to get orders for a given tokens
toporders gives out all orders irrespective of token , then those orders are filtered at front end , probably
********
orders are the fulfilled orders

top orders are the pending orders
********
finally clear ho hi gya !


top order response analysis

bc , every order has same token get , so how do we know whether the order buy order or sell order ? oh !
so each order has an id which has either '_buy' or '_sell'.
amount is -ve when user wants to sell
